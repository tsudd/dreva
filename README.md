# Dreva
Keep focus, while trees are growing.

## Try this out
This app already published using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
Open [Dreva](https://dreva-tsudd.web.app/) and see how it looks like.

## The concept
The result app should provide common functionality for setting up timers and placing selected trees on the screen (drag-and-drop prefered).

Here's the mockup for future app (can't be different from the actual app):
